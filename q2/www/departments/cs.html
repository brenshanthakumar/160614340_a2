                    <h3 class="header-4"> Professor: Alan Turing </h5>
                        <p class="details-2"> Alan Mathison Turing is an
                            English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and
                            theoretical biologist. Turing has been highly influential in the development of theoretical
                            computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation
                            with
                            the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.
                            Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial
                            intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home
                            country
                            during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, and because much of his work was covered by
                            the
                            Official Secrets Act. However, here at WDU we appreciate and celebrate Turings contributions.</p>

                    <h3 class="header-4"> Professor: Ada Lovelace </h5>
                        <p class="details-2"> Augusta Ada King is an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on
                            Charles
                            Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the
                            first
                            to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the
                            first
                            algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes
                            regarded
                            as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and one of the first
                            computer programmers.</p>
