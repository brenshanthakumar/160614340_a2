                    <p class="details-2">Sir Isaac Newton is an English
                        mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author (described in his own day as a
                        "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all
                        time, and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia
                        Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, laid the
                        foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares
                        credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.</p>

                <h3 class="header-4"> Professor: Florence Nightingale </h5>
                    <p class="details-2">Florence Nightingale is an English social reformer and statistician, and the founder of modern nursing.

                        Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and trainer of nurses during the
                        Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded soldiers. She gave nursing a favourable
                        reputation and became an icon of Victorian culture, especially in the persona of "The Lady with
                        the Lamp" making rounds of wounded soldiers at night.</p>
