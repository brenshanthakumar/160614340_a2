            At WDU, our machine learning course aims to empower students to use and understand the primary approaches so as to be able to modify them for specific uses. Our focus is less on theory and more on practice. Students engage in hands-on implementation of some of the fundamental algorithms such as predictive modeling and clustering applied to real, open-ended problems.
