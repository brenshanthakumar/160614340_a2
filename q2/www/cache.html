The cache is a location on the hard disk for web browsers to store assets and media for fast retrieval. The browser stores assets and media which have been downloaded when the user visits a website, allowing them to be retrieved from the cache if the user visits again. Since it is faster to read files from the cache than download them via the internet, it is much more efficient to load files for websites from a cache on the local hard disk if the user has already downloaded them before. Website cookies are stored in the cache, so when you clear your cache you are also deleting the data stored in cookies. Websites often use cookies to store important data about the user, such as if the user has triggered a pop-up before or not. In the case of MailChimp, the a cookie is created when the mailing list pop-up is triggered so that the user will not encounter the pop-up next time they visit the site. Therefore, deleting evidence that you have triggered the pop-up will trick the website into showing you a pop-up as if you're a first time user.
